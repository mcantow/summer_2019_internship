# summer_2019_intership
A compilation of my code, all with the purpose of web-scraping, written over the course of my 2019 summer internship at Jerrick Media


Note that websites change overtime, and the more time that has passed since these scripts were initially written implies they are less likely to still work. 

I don't recomend running the exact code I wrote for my purposes, rather I recomend using these files to learn how you can structure your own crawlers and see what can be done with Python parsing libraries.

intro.py is an introductory script to show the basics of what I am doing in these scripts
